I am applying for the position of Software Developer. With more than fifteen years of experience, I am just as comfortable writing and gathering product specifications as I am breaking them down to developer tasks in JIRA or just writing code.  In my career, I had the fortune to participate in the transformation of Simpleview from a few cowboy coders to a multi-national company with ~400 employees and hundreds of clients and offices around the world. I played a direct hand in Simpleview growth by taking ownership of a legacy CMS Platform and evolving it into a global scale platform relied on by the world's largest tourist destinations to deliver their web content. After the CMS matured, I decided to refresh my technical skillset and take on a lead developer role again. In the two years since then, I have been leading a team of 2 to 5 developers expanding our BI suite on our React, Node, MongoDB, MS SQL, and Linux stack all running on Docker images in a Kubernetes cluster. With CI/CD deployment from Github to GKE via CircleCI. I also have administrator-level experience with Jira, having championed, and performed the initial rollout. I also have extensive experience with Docker and the GKE Kubernetes Environment and CI/CD deployment via Circle CI. If you believe my qualifications are a good fit, I would love to discuss this position further. My email and phone number is gschaffer@gmail.com and 520-270-5290
